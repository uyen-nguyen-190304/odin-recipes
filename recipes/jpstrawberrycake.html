        <h2>Main Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For the sponge cake:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>4 large eggs</li>
                <li>2/3 cup or 130 grams granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup or 120 grams all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 cup or 60 grams unsalted butter, melted</li>
                <li>1/4 cup or 60 ml milk</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>For the filling and decoration:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li> 
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled and halved</li>
                <li>Whole strawberries for topping</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>   
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line the bottom of two 8-inch round cake pans with parchment paper. Do not grease the sides.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs with an electric mixer on high speed. Gradually add the sugar and continue beating until the mixture is thick, pale, and has tripled in volume.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour over the egg mixture in three additions, folding gently after each addition to avoid deflating the batter.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract. Take a small portion of the batter and mix it into the butter mixture to lighten it. Then, gently fold this back into the main batter until well combined.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the cakes are golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool completely in the pans on a wire rack.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract until soft peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip, as the cream should be light and spreadable.</li>
            <li>To assemble, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the top, then arrange the halved strawberries over the cream. Spread a thin layer of cream over the strawberries to help the top layer of cake adhere.</li>
            <li>Place the second cake layer on top, then spread the remaining whipped cream over the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with whole strawberries as desired.</li>
            <li>Chill the cake in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving. Slice and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
