        <p>Hello! My name is Uyen Nguyen, and I am taking The Odin Project as part of my journey to become a web developer, alongside my work as an AI Engineer. This is the first project we'll create during the TOP journeyâ€”a recipe page!</p>
        <p>I enjoy baking and creating different dessert dishes in my free time as a way to relax and have fun. Below are my top three favorite dishes. These recipes are beginner-friendly, and I believe you can make them too!</p>
